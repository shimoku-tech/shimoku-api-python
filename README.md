## About Shimoku

Shimoku enables you to build Data Products in just hours and allows you to create Predictive Analytics Products with Artificial Intelligence capabilities. In the software and automation era, data sharing is essential for businesses to thrive. Shimoku provides responsive progressive web apps that enable seamless data sharing between clients and providers.

Companies are more interested in predicting the future of their KPIs and trends rather than dwelling on past events. With Shimoku, you can build a Data App like Google Analytics in just hours without the need for a back-end, front-end, or DevOps. Additionally, you can integrate predictive suites into your Data App within minutes, transforming it into an AI App. Shimoku empowers you to deliver AI Apps that a single junior coder can build, iterate, and maintain.

### Introduction

Creating Data Apps usually requires a full-stack team of Data and IT specialists. Shimoku simplifies this process for Data professionals by allowing them to create Data Apps faster without the need for IT expertise. Shimoku reduces the workload of IT teams, which are often the bottleneck in digital businesses while creating new products and value for your clients.

By using Shimoku, a typical flow such as:

Is transformed into:

## Quickstart

### Step 1 - Install the library

```bash
pip install shimoku-api-python
```

### Step 2 - Configure the client

```python
from os import getenv
import shimoku_api_python as Shimoku

access_token = getenv('SHIMOKU_TOKEN')
universe_id: str = getenv('UNIVERSE_ID')
business_id: str = getenv('BUSINESS_ID')

s = Shimoku.Client(
    access_token=access_token,
    universe_id=universe_id,
    business_id=business_id,
)
```

### Step 3 - Create plots

```python
s.plt.set_dashboard('Custom Dashboard')

language_expressiveness = pd.read_html(
    'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_programming_languages')[2]

s.plt.bar(
  menu_path='catalog/bar-example', order=0, 
  title='Language expressiveness',
  data=language_expressiveness, x='Language',
  y=['Statements ratio[48]', 'Lines ratio[49]'],
)
```

### Step 4 (Optional) - Productivity boost

Enable asynchronous execution:

```python
s = Shimoku.Client(
    access_token=access_token,
    universe_id=universe_id,
    business_id=business_id,
    verbosity='INFO',
    async_execution=True,
)
```

Don't forget to call `s.run()` at the end of your code to ensure all tasks are executed before the program terminates.
